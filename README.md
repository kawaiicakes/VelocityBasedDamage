Highly-configurable, highly-compatible mod aiming to add more nuance and realism to damage in Minecraft. How it works is simple: the faster something is moving towards the target, the more damage it does. If the target is faster than the attacker, the less damage. That 'something' could be a sword, arrow, a horse, a boat, or even the player themselves crashing into a wall. Projectiles will also 'inherit' the velocity of whatever threw them, meaning throwing potions on horseback finally works properly!

Further details may be found below.

##### Planned features

##### Technical details
**Bolded** values are configurable. **Damage** is calculated with respect to the 'approach' speed of the attacker to the target. That is, the dot product of the normalized difference between attacker/target position and difference of attacker/target velocities with respect to the world. Some liberties have been taken with defining the positions of entities, however. Depending on whether the attacker is above or below the target (and vice versa), as well as the direction of velocity, position may be calculated either at the entity's "feet" or "eye" level. This was necessary to patch some unsavoury behaviours whereby a debuff is incurred in scenarios where it did not seem like there should be; despite the math being correct.



Projectiles calculate damage a little differently. As base damage of things is not affected by this mod, the crazy fast speed of projectiles often meant damage would jump up into the thousands, or even millions in the case of gun mods. This being the case, the approach speed of a projectile is always zero unless the targeted entity has a component of velocity moving either away or towards it. This fix can be disabled by enabling **wild mode.** Wild mode disables the nerfs necessary to not completely break some mechanics. In vanilla, arrows do damage depending on how fast they are travelling. This is disabled by default so the damage bonus is not 'double dipped'. This again may be re-enabled by enabling wild mode.
